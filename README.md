# AWS Misconfiguration Test Repository

⚠️ **SECURITY UPDATE**: The S3 bucket configuration has been updated to block public write access as per security remediation requirements. Critical public write vulnerabilities have been resolved while maintaining the educational/testing nature of the repository.

This repository contains intentionally misconfigured AWS infrastructure files designed for security testing, penetration testing, and educational purposes. **DO NOT USE THESE CONFIGURATIONS IN PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENTS.**

## Files Included

### Terraform Files
1. **terraform-s3-misconfigured.tf** - Misconfigured S3 bucket with public access
2. **terraform-ec2-misconfigured.tf** - Misconfigured EC2 instance with multiple security vulnerabilities

### CloudFormation Files
1. **cloudformation-s3-misconfigured.yaml** - Misconfigured S3 bucket using CloudFormation
2. **cloudformation-ec2-misconfigured.yaml** - Misconfigured EC2 instance using CloudFormation

## Security Misconfigurations Included

### S3 Bucket Misconfigurations
- ✅ Public access block enabled (SECURITY FIX: Blocks all public access)
- ✅ Private ACL configured (SECURITY FIX: No public read/write access)
- ❌ No server-side encryption
- ❌ Versioning disabled
- ❌ No access logging
- ✅ Public bucket policy removed (SECURITY FIX: No public access policies)
- ❌ No lifecycle policies
- ❌ No CloudTrail monitoring

### EC2 Instance Misconfigurations
- ❌ Security groups allowing access from 0.0.0.0/0 on multiple ports (SSH, RDP, HTTP, HTTPS, databases)
- ❌ IAM roles with excessive permissions (PowerUserAccess, IAMFullAccess)
- ❌ Hardcoded credentials in user data
- ❌ Unencrypted EBS volumes
- ❌ IMDSv1 enabled (vulnerable to SSRF attacks)
- ❌ No detailed monitoring
- ❌ Public IP assignment
- ❌ Weak user passwords
- ❌ SSH password authentication enabled
- ❌ Firewall disabled
- ❌ Sudo access without password requirements
- ❌ Sensitive information exposed via web interface

## Usage

### Prerequisites
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials
- Terraform installed (for .tf files)
- CloudFormation access (for .yaml files)

### Terraform Deployment
```bash
# For S3 misconfigured bucket
terraform init
terraform plan -var-file="terraform-s3-misconfigured.tf"
terraform apply -var-file="terraform-s3-misconfigured.tf"

# For EC2 misconfigured instance
terraform init
terraform plan -var-file="terraform-ec2-misconfigured.tf"
terraform apply -var-file="terraform-ec2-misconfigured.tf"
```

### CloudFormation Deployment
```bash
# For S3 misconfigured bucket
aws cloudformation create-stack \
  --stack-name misconfigured-s3-stack \
  --template-body file://cloudformation-s3-misconfigured.yaml

# For EC2 misconfigured instance
aws cloudformation create-stack \
  --stack-name misconfigured-ec2-stack \
  --template-body file://cloudformation-ec2-misconfigured.yaml \
  --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM
```

## Validation and Security Testing

### S3 Security Validation
A validation script is provided to verify that the S3 security improvements are working correctly:

```bash
# After deploying the S3 terraform configuration
./validate_s3_security.sh <your-bucket-name>
```

This script will verify:
- Public access block settings are correctly configured
- Bucket ACL is set to private
- Public write access is blocked
- All remediation requirements from security issue S3.3 are met

## Security Testing Tools

These misconfigurations can be detected by various security scanning tools:
- **AWS Config Rules**
- **AWS Security Hub**
- **AWS Inspector**
- **Scout Suite**
- **Prowler**
- **CloudSploit**
- **Checkov**
- **Terrascan**
- **tfsec**

## ⚠️ Important Warnings

1. **DO NOT deploy these in production environments**
2. **These resources will incur AWS charges**
3. **Public S3 buckets may be discovered and abused by attackers**
4. **EC2 instances with weak security groups are vulnerable to attacks**
5. **Always destroy resources after testing**: `terraform destroy` or `aws cloudformation delete-stack`
6. **Monitor your AWS bill and usage during testing**

## Educational Use Cases

- Security training and awareness
- Penetration testing practice
- Security tool validation
- Infrastructure security scanning
- DevSecOps pipeline testing
- Compliance testing

## Cleanup

Always remember to clean up resources after testing:

```bash
# Terraform cleanup
terraform destroy

# CloudFormation cleanup
aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name misconfigured-s3-stack
aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name misconfigured-ec2-stack
```
