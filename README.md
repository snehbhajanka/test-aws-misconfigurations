# AWS Misconfiguration Test Repository

This repository contains intentionally misconfigured AWS infrastructure files designed for security testing, penetration testing, and educational purposes. **DO NOT USE THESE CONFIGURATIONS IN PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENTS.**

## üîí SECURITY NOTICE

**CRITICAL ISSUE S3.3 RESOLVED** - Public write access to S3 buckets has been blocked. The following security fixes have been implemented:
- ‚úÖ Block Public Access settings enabled on all S3 buckets
- ‚úÖ Public read-write ACLs replaced with private ACLs  
- ‚úÖ Public bucket policies removed
- ‚úÖ Secure CloudFormation template created with comprehensive security controls

## Files Included

### Terraform Files
1. **terraform-s3-misconfigured.tf** - Misconfigured S3 bucket with public access
2. **terraform-ec2-misconfigured.tf** - Misconfigured EC2 instance with multiple security vulnerabilities

### CloudFormation Files
1. **terraform-s3-misconfigured.tf** - **SECURITY FIXED:** S3 bucket with proper security controls and blocked public write access
2. **terraform-ec2-misconfigured.tf** - Misconfigured EC2 instance with multiple security vulnerabilities

### CloudFormation Files
1. **cloudformation-s3-misconfigured.yaml** - **NEW:** Secure S3 bucket configuration with comprehensive security settings

## Security Misconfigurations Included

### S3 Bucket Security Status
- ‚úÖ **Public access block ENABLED** (SECURITY FIXED: Issue S3.3)
- ‚úÖ **Private ACL configured** (SECURITY FIXED: Issue S3.3)
- ‚ùå No server-side encryption (for educational purposes)
- ‚ùå Versioning disabled (for educational purposes)
- ‚úÖ **Access logging configured** (CloudFormation template)
- ‚úÖ **Public bucket policy REMOVED** (SECURITY FIXED: Issue S3.3)
- ‚úÖ **Lifecycle policies configured** (CloudFormation template)
- ‚úÖ **CloudWatch monitoring configured** (CloudFormation template)

**CRITICAL SECURITY ISSUE S3.3 RESOLVED:** Public write access to S3 buckets has been blocked.

### EC2 Instance Misconfigurations
- ‚ùå Security groups allowing access from 0.0.0.0/0 on multiple ports (SSH, RDP, HTTP, HTTPS, databases)
- ‚ùå IAM roles with excessive permissions (PowerUserAccess, IAMFullAccess)
- ‚ùå Hardcoded credentials in user data
- ‚ùå Unencrypted EBS volumes
- ‚ùå IMDSv1 enabled (vulnerable to SSRF attacks)
- ‚ùå No detailed monitoring
- ‚ùå Public IP assignment
- ‚ùå Weak user passwords
- ‚ùå SSH password authentication enabled
- ‚ùå Firewall disabled
- ‚ùå Sudo access without password requirements
- ‚ùå Sensitive information exposed via web interface

## Usage

### Prerequisites
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials
- Terraform installed (for .tf files)
- CloudFormation access (for .yaml files)

### Terraform Deployment
```bash
# For S3 misconfigured bucket
terraform init
terraform plan -var-file="terraform-s3-misconfigured.tf"
terraform apply -var-file="terraform-s3-misconfigured.tf"

# For EC2 misconfigured instance
terraform init
terraform plan -var-file="terraform-ec2-misconfigured.tf"
terraform apply -var-file="terraform-ec2-misconfigured.tf"
```

### CloudFormation Deployment
```bash
# For S3 misconfigured bucket
aws cloudformation create-stack \
  --stack-name misconfigured-s3-stack \
  --template-body file://cloudformation-s3-misconfigured.yaml

# For EC2 misconfigured instance
aws cloudformation create-stack \
  --stack-name misconfigured-ec2-stack \
  --template-body file://cloudformation-ec2-misconfigured.yaml \
  --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM
```

## Security Testing Tools

These misconfigurations can be detected by various security scanning tools:
- **AWS Config Rules**
- **AWS Security Hub**
- **AWS Inspector**
- **Scout Suite**
- **Prowler**
- **CloudSploit**
- **Checkov**
- **Terrascan**
- **tfsec**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Warnings

1. **DO NOT deploy these in production environments**
2. **These resources will incur AWS charges**
3. **Public S3 buckets may be discovered and abused by attackers**
4. **EC2 instances with weak security groups are vulnerable to attacks**
5. **Always destroy resources after testing**: `terraform destroy` or `aws cloudformation delete-stack`
6. **Monitor your AWS bill and usage during testing**

## Educational Use Cases

- Security training and awareness
- Penetration testing practice
- Security tool validation
- Infrastructure security scanning
- DevSecOps pipeline testing
- Compliance testing

## Cleanup

Always remember to clean up resources after testing:

```bash
# Terraform cleanup
terraform destroy

# CloudFormation cleanup
aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name misconfigured-s3-stack
aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name misconfigured-ec2-stack
```
