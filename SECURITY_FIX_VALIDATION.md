# S3 Public Write Access Security Fix Validation

## Issue Fixed
- **Control ID**: S3.3
- **Issue**: S3 general purpose buckets should block public write access
- **Severity**: CRITICAL
- **Source**: AWS Security Hub

## Changes Made

### 1. Public Access Block Configuration
**Before:**
```hcl
resource "aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block" "misconfigured_pab" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.misconfigured_bucket.id

  block_public_acls       = false
  block_public_policy     = false
  ignore_public_acls      = false
  restrict_public_buckets = false
}
```

**After:**
```hcl
resource "aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block" "misconfigured_pab" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.misconfigured_bucket.id

  block_public_acls       = true
  block_public_policy     = true
  ignore_public_acls      = true
  restrict_public_buckets = true
}
```

### 2. Bucket ACL Configuration
**Before:**
```hcl
resource "aws_s3_bucket_acl" "misconfigured_acl" {
  depends_on = [aws_s3_bucket_ownership_controls.s3_bucket_acl_ownership]
  bucket     = aws_s3_bucket.misconfigured_bucket.id
  acl        = "public-read-write"
}
```

**After:**
```hcl
resource "aws_s3_bucket_acl" "misconfigured_acl" {
  depends_on = [aws_s3_bucket_ownership_controls.s3_bucket_acl_ownership]
  bucket     = aws_s3_bucket.misconfigured_bucket.id
  acl        = "private"
}
```

### 3. Public Bucket Policy Removed
**Before:**
```hcl
resource "aws_s3_bucket_policy" "misconfigured_policy" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.misconfigured_bucket.id

  policy = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17"
    Statement = [
      {
        Sid       = "PublicReadWrite"
        Effect    = "Allow"
        Principal = "*"
        Action = [
          "s3:GetObject",
          "s3:PutObject",
          "s3:DeleteObject",
          "s3:ListBucket"
        ]
        Resource = [
          aws_s3_bucket.misconfigured_bucket.arn,
          "${aws_s3_bucket.misconfigured_bucket.arn}/*",
        ]
      },
    ]
  })
}
```

**After:**
```hcl
# SECURITY FIX: Removed public bucket policy that allowed write access
# (Public write access policy intentionally removed for security)
```

## Security Impact

The implemented changes address the AWS Security Hub control S3.3 by:

1. **Blocking Public ACLs**: `block_public_acls = true` prevents new public ACLs from being applied
2. **Ignoring Public ACLs**: `ignore_public_acls = true` ignores existing public ACLs  
3. **Blocking Public Policies**: `block_public_policy = true` prevents public bucket policies from being applied
4. **Restricting Public Buckets**: `restrict_public_buckets = true` restricts access to buckets with public policies
5. **Private ACL**: Changed from `public-read-write` to `private` to remove public access
6. **Removed Public Policy**: Completely removed the bucket policy that granted public write access

## Compliance Status
- ✅ **S3.3 Control**: S3 general purpose buckets should block public write access
- ✅ **Public Write Access**: Blocked at multiple levels (access block, ACL, policy)
- ✅ **Defense in Depth**: Multiple overlapping security controls implemented

## Verification Commands

To verify these settings are applied correctly in AWS:

```bash
# Check public access block settings
aws s3api get-public-access-block --bucket <bucket-name>

# Check bucket ACL
aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucket-name>

# Check bucket policy (should return error if no policy exists)
aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket <bucket-name>
```

Expected results:
- Public access block: All settings should be `true`
- Bucket ACL: Should show private permissions only
- Bucket policy: Should return "NoSuchBucketPolicy" error (policy removed)
