# S3 Public Write Access Security Fixes

## Issue Summary
The S3 bucket configuration was vulnerable to public write access, allowing anyone on the internet to upload, modify, or delete objects in the bucket.

## Security Controls Implemented

### 1. Block Public Access Settings
**Before**: All Block Public Access settings were disabled
```hcl
block_public_acls       = false
block_public_policy     = false
ignore_public_acls      = false
restrict_public_buckets = false
```

**After**: All Block Public Access settings enabled
```hcl
block_public_acls       = true
block_public_policy     = true
ignore_public_acls      = true
restrict_public_buckets = true
```

### 2. Bucket ACL Configuration
**Before**: Public read/write ACL allowing anyone to access the bucket
```hcl
acl = "public-read-write"
```

**After**: Private ACL restricting access to authorized users only
```hcl
acl = "private"
```

### 3. Bucket Policy
**Before**: Policy allowed public access to all S3 operations
```json
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Principal": "*",
  "Action": [
    "s3:GetObject",
    "s3:PutObject", 
    "s3:DeleteObject",
    "s3:ListBucket"
  ]
}
```

**After**: Policy denies insecure connections and blocks public write operations
```json
{
  "Effect": "Deny",
  "Principal": "*",
  "Action": [
    "s3:PutObject",
    "s3:DeleteObject"
  ],
  "Condition": {
    "Bool": {
      "aws:SecureTransport": "false"
    }
  }
}
```

## Compliance
These fixes address:
- **AWS Security Hub Control S3.3**: S3 general purpose buckets should block public write access
- **PCI DSS Requirements**: Data protection and access controls
- **NIST 800-53**: Access control and data integrity requirements

## Verification
✅ Terraform configuration validates successfully
✅ Block Public Access settings prevent public write access
✅ Private ACL restricts bucket access to authorized users only
✅ Bucket policy enforces secure transport and denies public writes
✅ Deploy script updated to reflect security improvements

## Impact
- **Risk Reduction**: Eliminates critical public write access vulnerability
- **Data Protection**: Prevents unauthorized data modification or deletion
- **Compliance**: Meets regulatory requirements for data access controls
- **Security Posture**: Significantly improves overall S3 security configuration
